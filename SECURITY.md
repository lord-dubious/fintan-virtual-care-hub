# Security Policy

## üîí **Security Overview**

Dr. Fintan's Virtual Care Hub takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, policies, and procedures for reporting vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Measures Implemented**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin, Provider, and Patient roles with appropriate permissions
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds (default: 12)
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure logout
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Ready for implementation (infrastructure in place)

### **Data Protection**
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and Content Security Policy
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing requests
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit

### **Network Security**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic over HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers to prevent XSS
- **HSTS Headers**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration in environment variables
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- **Database Security**: Connection pooling and SSL connections
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive information

### **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Security Event Logging**: Authentication attempts and security events
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error monitoring with Sentry integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: API performance and security metrics
- **Audit Trails**: User actions and administrative changes logged

## üö® **Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### **How to Report**
1. **Email**: Send details to `security@drfintan.com`
2. **Subject**: Include "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the subject line
3. **Details**: Provide as much detail as possible including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### **What to Include**
- **Vulnerability Type**: XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication bypass, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Specific files, endpoints, or features
- **Proof of Concept**: Safe demonstration of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, and other relevant details

### **Response Timeline**
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity (Critical: 24-48 hours, High: 1 week, Medium: 2 weeks)
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

## üîç **Security Testing**

### **Automated Security Testing**
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules and CodeQL analysis
- **Secret Scanning**: GitGuardian integration for credential detection
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning

### **Manual Security Testing**
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code review process
- **Authentication Testing**: Login, session management, and authorization testing
- **Input Validation Testing**: Boundary testing and injection attempts

### **Security Checklist**
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented on all endpoints
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Security headers properly configured
- [ ] Dependencies regularly updated
- [ ] Secrets properly managed
- [ ] Logging and monitoring in place

## üîß **Security Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-here
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# HTTPS Configuration
ENABLE_HTTPS_ONLY=true
HSTS_MAX_AGE=31536000
```

### **Security Headers**
```javascript
// Implemented security headers
{
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
  "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload",
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; ..."
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Security Best Practices for Developers**

### **Code Security**
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
5. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data

### **Dependency Management**
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like `npm audit`
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary packages
4. **License Compliance**: Ensure license compatibility

### **Data Handling**
1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. **Minimal Data**: Collect only necessary data
3. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
4. **Secure Deletion**: Securely delete sensitive data when no longer needed

## üìã **Compliance & Standards**

### **Healthcare Compliance**
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Privacy and security safeguards for health information
- **Data Protection**: GDPR compliance for EU users
- **Medical Device Regulations**: Compliance with relevant medical software standards

### **Security Standards**
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Following cybersecurity best practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles

## üîÑ **Security Updates**

### **Update Process**
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular security assessments
2. **Patch Management**: Timely application of security patches
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of security updates
4. **Deployment**: Secure deployment procedures
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment security monitoring
