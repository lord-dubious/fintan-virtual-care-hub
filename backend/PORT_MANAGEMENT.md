# 🔧 Port Management & Cleanup Solution

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Port 3000 stays in use after server crashes or forceful shutdown, preventing restart.

**Root Cause**: When Node.js processes crash or are killed abruptly, they don't properly release the port, leaving it in a "bound" state.

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Port Cleanup on Startup**
The server now automatically:
- ✅ Checks if port 3000 is available before starting
- ✅ Kills any processes using the port if found
- ✅ Verifies port is free after cleanup
- ✅ Provides clear error messages if port can't be freed

### 2. **Enhanced Graceful Shutdown**
- ✅ Properly closes HTTP server connections
- ✅ Closes Socket.IO connections gracefully
- ✅ Closes database connections
- ✅ Handles multiple shutdown signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT)
- ✅ 15-second timeout protection against hanging shutdowns

### 3. **Port Management Utility**
- ✅ `scripts/port-manager.js` - Comprehensive port management tool
- ✅ Check which processes are using a port
- ✅ Kill processes using a specific port
- ✅ Detailed process information and logging

### 4. **NPM Scripts for Easy Management**
- ✅ `npm run kill-port` - Kill processes on port 3000
- ✅ `npm run clean-start` - Kill port processes and start dev server

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Fix for Port Issues
```bash
# Kill any processes using port 3000
npm run kill-port

# Or kill and start in one command
npm run clean-start
```

### Manual Port Management
```bash
# Check what's using port 3000
node scripts/port-manager.js check 3000

# Kill processes on port 3000
node scripts/port-manager.js kill 3000

# Check a different port
node scripts/port-manager.js check 8080
```

### Normal Development
```bash
# Start server (now with automatic port cleanup)
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Startup Sequence
1. **Port Check** → Server checks if port 3000 is available
2. **Auto Cleanup** → If port is busy, kills processes using it
3. **Verification** → Confirms port is now free
4. **Server Start** → Starts server on clean port
5. **Error Handling** → Exits gracefully if port can't be freed

### Shutdown Sequence
1. **Signal Detection** → Catches CTRL+C, kill signals, crashes
2. **HTTP Cleanup** → Stops accepting new connections
3. **Socket.IO Cleanup** → Disconnects all WebSocket clients
4. **Database Cleanup** → Closes Prisma connections
5. **Port Release** → Port becomes available immediately

## 📋 Example Logs

### Successful Startup (Port Free)
```
🔍 Checking if port 3000 is available...
✅ Port 3000 is available
🚀 Dr. Fintan Virtual Care Hub Backend API Server started
🌐 Server running on port 3000
```

### Startup with Port Conflict
```
🔍 Checking if port 3000 is available...
⚠️ Port 3000 is already in use. Attempting to free it...
🔍 Found 1 process(es) using port 3000: 12345
💀 Killed process 12345 using port 3000
✅ Port 3000 is now available
🚀 Dr. Fintan Virtual Care Hub Backend API Server started
```

### Graceful Shutdown
```
⌨️ SIGINT received (Ctrl+C)
🛑 Received SIGINT. Starting graceful shutdown...
📊 Shutting down server...
✅ HTTP server closed successfully
🔌 Closing Socket.IO connections...
✅ Socket.IO connections closed
🗄️ Closing database connections...
✅ Database connections closed
🎉 Graceful shutdown completed successfully
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Port Still Stuck?
```bash
# Check what's using the port
npm run kill-port

# Or use the detailed utility
node scripts/port-manager.js check 3000

# Force kill with system command
sudo lsof -ti:3000 | xargs sudo kill -9
```

### Server Won't Start?
1. **Check port availability**: `npm run kill-port`
2. **Check for permission issues**: Ensure you can bind to port 3000
3. **Check environment variables**: Verify PORT is set correctly
4. **Check logs**: Look for specific error messages in console

## 🔒 Safety Features

- ✅ **Timeout Protection** - Server force-exits after 15 seconds if shutdown hangs
- ✅ **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of cleanup failures
- ✅ **Process Verification** - Confirms processes are actually killed
- ✅ **Detailed Logging** - Clear messages about what's happening
- ✅ **Multiple Signal Support** - Handles various shutdown scenarios

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **No More Port Conflicts** - Automatic cleanup prevents "port in use" errors
2. **Faster Development** - No manual process killing needed
3. **Reliable Shutdowns** - Proper resource cleanup prevents data corruption
4. **Better Debugging** - Clear logs show exactly what's happening
5. **Production Ready** - Handles Docker, PM2, and manual deployments

Your server now handles port conflicts and shutdowns like a production-grade application! 🚀
